# A-Water

A-Water is a tad bit of a misnomer, as the library, presently, only contains code for adding an infinite procedural ocean for the [A-Frame Web Framework](https://aframe.io/). It is a simple drop-in component that allows you produce animated rolling ocean waves in your creations. Click [here](https://code-panda.com/pages/projects/a_ocean/v_0_1_0) to see this project in action (**Warning: requires a powerful GPU - do not open on a mobile phone**).

## Prerequisites

This is built for the [A-Frame Web Framework](https://aframe.io/) version 1.2.0+. It also requires a Web XR compatible web browser.

`https://aframe.io/releases/1.3.0/aframe.min.js`

## Installing

When installing A-Ocean, you'll want to copy the *a-water.v0.1.0.min.js* file, along with the *assets** folder into their own directory in your JavaScript folder. Afterwards, add the minified file into a script tag in your html.

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.3.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<script src="{PATH_TO_JS_FOLDER}/a-water.v0.1.1.min.js"></script>
```

Once these references are set up, add the `<a-ocean>` component into your `<a-scene>` tag from A-Frame like so and make sure to include a camera element so the ocean can track along your position. `<a-ocean>` uses a static mesh plane around your camera, and then modifies the surface of that ocean by varying your position on the displacement map procedurally, giving you the 'appearance' of an infinite ocean without popping artifacts that occur from adding new mesh along the horizon.

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>
  <a-ocean></a-ocean>
</a-scene>
```

This barebones code will provide you with an infinite scrolling oceans that will track your scenes primary camera. In addition to this basic setup, the following parameters are also available to help you customize your ocean according to your desired environment. These can be found in the `ocean-state` attribute which should be set inside `<a-ocean>`.

**Property** | **Description**
:--- | :---
`large_normal_map` | The location of the large wave normal map used for surface details relative to the webpage folder.
`small_normal_map` | The location of the small wave normal map used for surface details relative to the webpage folder.
`height_offset` | The height, in world coordinates, of the infinite water plane relative to 0m.
`wind_velocity` | The velocity of the wind, higher wind speeds result in larger waves.
`draw_distance` | The maximum distance away from the camera, for which wave tiles will be added.
`patch_size` | The width and length of patches that will be added to the scene to fill in the space between the camera and the `draw_distance`
`patch_data_size` | The pixel dimensions of the output FFT shader.
`patch_vertex_size` | The length and width of the number of vertices in each patch.
`wave_scale_multiple` | Increases the size of the waves by a multiple of this number.
`number_of_octaves` | The number of octaves to use in the FFT simulation.
`large_normal_map_strength` | Sets the strength of the normal for the large normal map texture. Higher strengths give the appearance of more extreme surface features.
`small_normal_map_strength` | Sets the strength of the normal for the small normal map texture. Higher strengths give the appearance of more extreme surface features.
`light_scattering_amounts` | A 3-Vector that gives the amount of each light absorbed/scattered for each color component, red, green and blue. Higher values result in water that looks more clear, while lower values make the water look murkier. The relative values for these decides the overall color for the water and is also used to decide the base scattering for direct light based on wave height.
`linear_scattering_height_offset` | Gives the starting point for the fake wave-height scattering to begin.
`linear_scattering_total_wave_height` | Gives the total approximate height for your wave which is used as a multiple in the linear effect.

##Setting File Locations

The wave simulation makes use of two normal maps which provide multi-scale detailing to improve the look of the waves on the ocean plane. By default, the system presumes these are located in `./image-dir/a-water-assets/water-normal-1.png` (large) and `./image-dir/a-water-assets/water-normal-2.png` (small). However, you can set the locations of these files yourself in the event that you are using a different file structure for your scene with the `large_normal_map` and `small_normal_map` properties.

```html
  <a-ocean ocean-state="large_normal_map: './my-image-files/custom-large-normal-map.png';
    small_normal_map: './my-image-files/custom-small-normal-map.png';"></a-ocean>
```

If you are using custom normal maps for the surface of your ocean water, you can set the strength of their normals through the `large_normal_map_strength` and `small_normal_map_strength` properties. 1.0 is the natural strength of the normal map you provided, while higher values increase the intensity of the normal map and lower values decrease the value. These values do not start out at 1.0 by default, so if you are using a custom normal map, you may wish to change them.

```html
  <a-ocean ocean-state="large_normal_map: './my-image-files/custom-large-normal-map.png';
    small_normal_map: './my-image-files/custom-small-normal-map.png';
    large_normal_map_strength: 1.0;
    small_normal_map_strength: 0.5;"></a-ocean>
```

Another common desire is to change the default height of the water level. This can be easily set by modifying the `height_offset` property.

```html
  <a-ocean ocean-state="height_offset: 50;"></a-ocean>
```

The ocean starts off with some pretty big waves, however, you can make the waves bigger or smaller by changing the `wind_velocity` property. Note that `wind_velocity` is a 2-D vector, as the wind has both a magnitude and a direction. Each component of this vector is the wind velocity along it's respective axis, the wind speed in the x direction and y direction, for instance. The higher the wind velocity, the larger the waves that will result.

```html
  <!-- +2 wind velocity in the positive x direction and -0.5 in the y direction -->
  <a-ocean ocean-state="wind_velocity: 2.0 -0.5;"></a-ocean>
```

The `light_scattering_amounts` property allows you to control the murkiness/clarity of the water and the color of the water in a single property. This property has three components for the red, green and blue channels of light being scattered and refracted through the water. The higher these values, the more clear that particular channel will be, the lower the value, the murkier that color will be - this also sets the color of the water, as allowing more red or blue light through will result in water that looks more red or blue respectively. This also impacts the color of the faked scattering effect. `<a-ocean>` automatically looks for the brightest direct lighting in the scene at startup, and will use this along with the wave height to emulate light scattering through ocean waves. The color of these waves is impacted by the ratios of the colors provided in this property and the color of the direct lighting in the scene.

```html
  <!-- Murky algea bloom! -->
  <a-ocean ocean-state="light_scattering_amounts: 10 11 7;"></a-ocean>
```

```html
  <!-- Cyan depths! -->
  <a-ocean ocean-state="light_scattering_amounts: 200 550 560;"></a-ocean>
```

```html
  <a-ocean ocean-state="height_offset: 50;"></a-ocean>
```

The `draw_distance` property says how far away to draw tiles, beyond this value, new tiles will not be generated. The size of the tiles is set by the `patch_size` property. This will also impact the size of the waves generated. The number of vertices on each individual patch, and the size of the heightmap associated with it, is set by the `patch_data_size` property. These can be used to increase the beauty of the scene or increase performance, and there is a healthy balance between the three that needs to be kept if modifying these properties. If, however, you change the patch size, because this changes the size of the output FFT texture, you will also need to modify the `number_of_octaves` that are in use by the FFT transformer. Overall, the easiest way to increase or decrease performance is through `draw_distance`, as it doesn't have sucha  complicated interplay between components.

```html
  <!-- The waves will go way out now! -->
  <a-ocean ocean-state="draw_distance: 2000.0"></a-ocean>
```

The `linear_scattering_height_offset` and `linear_scattering_total_wave_height` are used to control the fake light scattering amounts inside of the waves that results from the direct lighting in the scene. The equation that drives this lighting is just a linear function of the heightmap of the waves given by *(wave_height  + linear_scattering_height_offset) / linear_scattering_total_wave_height*. The linear scattering height offset decides how high up to begin the scattering effect, and the linear scattering total wave height is used to normalize this to the height of the wave (we unfortunately don't know the maximum wave height ahead of time). So the first variable moves this linear effect up and down while the second spreads the effect out over a wider height range.

```html
  <!--For really big waves -->
  <a-ocean ocean-state="linear_scattering_height_offset: -5.0;
  linear_scattering_total_wave_height: 30;"></a-ocean>
```

##Making Things Transparent

For semi-distant objects, like non-rideable boats, whose decks are always above water, but below your camera, or regions of land that go below sea-level, you can emulate masking parts of the ocean tiles off by importing a mesh in the shape of the mask you wish to add to the scene and then adding the `ocean-static-mask` attribute to the property.

This feature is dependent upon a couple of special circumstances. The mesh underneath the mesh must not be transparent, or else it will be masked as well. Also, the mesh region you wish to mask out must always be below the mask, but the mask must always be above the water. That is to say, this is useful if you have a boat in light waves, but not for a large ship, if you wish to enter into the cargo hold. It also won't work if the ship has windows that require the materials to have transparency enabled as unfortunately this messes with the draw order and breaks this technique.

```html
  <!-- Our Ocean Planes -->
  <a-ocean ocean-state="height_offset: 35;"></a-ocean>

  <!--The mask that hides the ocean or anything transparent beneath it-->
  <a-plane height="40" width="200" position="-450.0 125.0 0.0" rotation="-90 0 0" ocean-static-mask></a-plane>

  <!-- The object we want visible beneath the ocean -->
  <a-box height="40" depth="40" width="40" position="-450.0 25.0 0.0"></a-box>
```
